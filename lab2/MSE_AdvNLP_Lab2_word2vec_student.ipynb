      "    The word2vec algorithms include skip-gram and CBOW models, using either\n",

      "    Usage examples\n",
      "    ==============\n",
      "\n",
      "    Initialize a model with e.g.:\n",
      "\n",
      "    .. sourcecode:: pycon\n",
      "\n",
      "        >>> from gensim.test.utils import common_texts\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "    **The training is streamed, so ``sentences`` can be an iterable**, reading input data\n",
      "    from the disk or network on-the-fly, without loading your entire corpus into RAM.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Note the ``sentences`` iterable must be *restartable* (not just a generator), to allow the algorithm\n",
      "    to stream over your dataset multiple times. For some examples of streamed iterables,\n",
      "    see :class:`~gensim.models.word2vec.BrownCorpus`,\n",
      "    :class:`~gensim.models.word2vec.Text8Corpus` or :class:`~gensim.models.word2vec.LineSentence`.\n",

      "        (0, 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "    The trained word vectors are stored in a :class:`~gensim.models.keyedvectors.KeyedVectors` instance, as `model.wv`:\n",

      "        >>> sims = model.wv.most_similar('computer', topn=10)  # get other similar words\n",
      "\n",
      "    The reason for separating the trained vectors into `KeyedVectors` is that if you don't\n",
      "    need the full model state any more (don't need to continue training), its state can be discarded,\n",
      "    keeping just the vectors and their keys proper.\n",
      "\n",
      "    This results in a much smaller and faster object that can be mmapped for lightning\n",
      "    fast loading and sharing the vectors in RAM between processes:\n",

      "\n",
