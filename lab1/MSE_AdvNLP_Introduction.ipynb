    "### First option: Conda environment manager\n",
    "If you want to manage several versions of Python and its modules, a good idea is to install an environment manager such as Conda.   Before installing Python and Jupyter locally, installing Conda will help you manage different versions of Python and of other modules on your computer, for instance for several courses.  (You may wish to install Conda before Python, but you can also do it later, in which case it will install its own Python libraries.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Miniconda is a minimal environment manager, while Anaconda is a larger software distribution that includes also Python and R software.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To install Conda, follow the instructions at https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html and consider installing Miniconda. Follow the instructions for your OS: Windows, Linux or MacOS.\n",
    "* You will be prompted to get a suitable installer from https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html (an executable for Windows, or a `bash` script for Linux).\n",
    "* In Linux, run `wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` and then\n",
    "`bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`\n",
    "* Conda commands are the same on all OSs -- the most important ones are for creating and loading an environment\n",
    "* after you install Conda, commands are performed from the command line (command prompt, a Power Shell, Anaconda Prompt, etc.)\n",
    "* try `conda info` for a start.\n",
    "* to get familiar with Conda: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html\n",
    "* cheatsheat of Conda commands: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html\n",
    "* to create an environment called *AdvNLP* for this course and activate it:\n",
    "   * `conda create --name AdvNLP python=3.11`\n",
    "   * `conda activate AdvNLP`\n",
    "   * `conda list` to see what is installed in the current environment\n",
